Changed:
Undervoltage: 20V -> 38V
Over voltage: 55 ->58V
Peak amp mode OFF
Throttle Rate: 100%

Throttle set to 0-5V mode
Throttle linearization changed to be fully linear (except 1 -> 0 so we turn off) ("Throttle Linearization" tab)
Throttle to Speed curve set to be linear (Throttle Settings)
Torque set to 100% at all speeds (I think this gives full current at all settings)

Check Throttle Rate
Check high pedal disable
Check max forward motor speed? Does this affect peak voltage?
